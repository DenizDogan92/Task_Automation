# Vocabulary Builder

One of my favorite scripts. It helps you to improve your English vocabulary by keeping track of your unknown words. 

This script builds a dictionary file from your unknown vocabulary words automatically after you get the definition of the word. Then, you can keep track of your unknown words.

It uses  [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/)  to get information (definition, synonyms, examples, etc.) about the word. 

**Required Packages:** 

- requests
- tkinter

Here is the command line usage:

`usage: python vocabulary_builder.py [WORD] -o [OPTIONS]`

If no argument is given, it shows a random WORD from your dictionary
If WORD argument is given, it shows the definition of the WORD and saves to your dictionary if not exist

`OPTIONS:`

  `list : list WORDS in your dictionary`

  `delete WORD : deletes the WORD from your dictionary`

  `gui : show a random WORD from your dictionary in GUI`



**Example usage 1**:  Get definition of the word "research"

`python vocabulary_builder.py research`

**Output:**

Word: research

Definitions:
1. inquire into
Synonyms: explore, search
Ex: the students had to research the history of the Second World War for their history project
2. a search for knowledge
Synonyms: enquiry, inquiry
Ex: their pottery deserves more research than it has received
3. attempt to find out in a systematically and scientific manner
Ex: The student researched the history of that word
4. systematic investigation to establish facts

The word "research" is then automatically added to your dictionary file.



**Example usage 2:** List the words in your dictionary file:

`python vocabulary_builder.py -o list`

**Output:**

Vocabulary Words:

efficacy

hamper

dormant

salient

jeopardize

mundane

research



**Example usage 3:** Delete a word from your dictionary file:

`python vocabulary_builder.py -o delete research`

**Output:**

Deleting word 'research' in english_vocabulary.json

Vocabulary Words:

efficacy

hamper

dormant

salient

jeopardize

mundane



**Example usage 4:** Show a random word from your dictionary file in GUI

`python vocabulary_builder.py -o gui`

**Output:**

You can add `python vocabulary_builder.py -o gui` command as a cron job on your linux machine if you want to be reminded of your unknown words regularly.
